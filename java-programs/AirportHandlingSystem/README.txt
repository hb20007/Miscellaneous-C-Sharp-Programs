The program is fully functional. I tested it well and I hope there are no mistakes/errors anywhere.

The program was built over a week of intense programming. There is a total of 19 classes.

No code was borrowed from anywhere. 

The image titled AirportEntityRelationshipModel.png is an Entity Relationship Model I made for the case in order to help me decide on the variables in the classes based on how they are related by composition.

The 2 .ucls files are class diagrams that can be viewed using Eclipse. The first one (ClassDiagram.ucls) is the main one and involves the 5 main classes which are shown in the Entity Relationship Model. This one is also provided as a .jpg file titles ScenarioClassDiagram. OtherClassDiagram.ucls involves the other classes created while programming. It does not show inheritence from standard java classes such as Jframe.

The code is explained in detail via in-line comments. 

All the functionality required was implemented. Some extra functionality was added in various places as well.

Managing the runways was implemented in a way different from the one outlined in the project description so there are many comments that describe how it works. The end result, however, is the same and planes are only allowed to take off or land by booking an available runway if there is one available

I have also generated a JavaDoc for my project in the folder doc/ which describes all the classes
